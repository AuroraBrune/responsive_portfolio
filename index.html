    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-3">Hello, first off, I'll share that as you look over my pages you'll notice that my favorite
        color is blue. I grew up as a Military Dependent in a large family. My father was in the Air Force and we did
        some moving. I felt settled in my elementary years in Sacramento, CA. We moved to Germany for three years, which
        was a wonderful experience for a young girl. My time as a military kid gave me the love of travel. I worked
        since I was ten years old, beginning with babysitting. I've always been good at Math and love puzzles.
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-3">I joined the Air Force after High School and worked in Aircraft Avionics. I've worked many
        jobs, with the past 22 years in Preschool and Elementary Education. My current job is a Special Education
        Para-Educator which I have worked for the past 18 years. Along with that job, I've worked for three years, as
        Program Director for the After School Program/Summer Day Camp at the local Parks and Rec Department.
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-3">With the recent event with the Covid-19 virus, both of my jobs came to a sudden stop. Soon,
        I continued in a small way working with the elementary school as a para, using Zoom to contact the staff team
        members as well as Zoom lessons for the children. The City closed the Parks and Rec child care program at least
        for the Summer Camp, but probably the entire program.
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-3">This leads me to the KU Coding Bootcamp program. I feel that Coding can tap into my skills
        and use my talents in a better way, and if some other issue comes along as the virus shutting businesses down,
        maybe this can offer me a way to keep working and contributing.
        The computer programming is challenging but rewarding when I find a solution and learn new ways to find code
        that works for a project. I hope to work for a dynamic company who appreciates the talent of the employees and
        offers teamwork and support.
