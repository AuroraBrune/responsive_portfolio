      <div class="col-lg-2"> I'm Aurora Brune a Full-Stack Web Developer. I recently graduated from the
        University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. I grew up as a Military Dependent in a large family. My father served in
        the Air Force and
        I joined the Air Force after High School. I worked in Aircraft Electronics in
        Avionics on C-5 and C-141 aircraft. I've always been good at Math and love puzzles.

      <div class="col-lg-2">Currently a Special Education Paraprofessional for 18 years, in addition
        to a second job as a Program Director for the Parks and Recreation After School/Summer Day Camp.
        I grew the program to a current enrollment of over 80, with up to 33 staff members over the busy
        Summer Day Camp season. Working these two jobs has been rewarding and challenging. With the recent
        events from Covid-19 virus, both of my jobs closed.
        I worked from home for the elementary school, using online Zoom lessons and meetings.
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-2">This leads me to KU Coding Bootcamp program. I feel that Coding can tap into my skills
        and use my talents in a better way, this can allow me to continue working and contributing.
        The computer programming is challenging but rewarding when I find a solution and learn new ways to find code
        that works for a project. I hope to work for a dynamic company who appreciates the talent of the employees and
        offers teamwork and support.

    <p>For my group project we developed a website that provides information about NASA and the SpaceX program. Users
      can
      select flights and download flight data about those missions. This site can be used by the curious and in a
      classroom
      setting for students and teachers to learn more about the space exploration history of NASA and SpaceX.

      I enjoyed creating a weather app that users can use to follow the weather for cities in the US. The site was
      created using HTML, CSS3,
      Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery and includes three api calls. Give it a try.

      Check out my day planner app that can help you keep your day's events organized. This app features dynamically
      updated
      HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
