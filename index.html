      <div class="col-lg-2"> I'm Aurora Brune a Full-Stack Web Developer. I recently graduated from the
        University of Kansas Coding Bootcamp. I grew up as a Military dependent in a large family. My father served in
        the Air Force and I joined the Air Force after High School. I worked on Aircraft maintaining and 
        troubleshooting Avionics on C-5 and C-141 aircraft, which is comparable to debugging. A problem solver, math and 
        science person who loves the outdoors and gardening.
      </div>      
      <div class="col-lg-2">Currently, a Special Education Paraprofessional for 18 years and additionally, for last several years, I
        also worked a second position for the city's Parks and Recreation Department as Program Director of the After School/Summer Day Camp.
        Not afraid to take responsibities, I grew this program to a current enrollment of over 80, with up to 33 staff members over the busy
        Summer Day Camp season. Working these two jobs has been rewarding and challenging, but with the recent events transpiring from 
        Covid-19 virus, like for many individuals, both of these positions have been severely impacted.
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-2">This leads me to KU Coding Bootcamp program. I feel coding can tap into my existing skillsets;
        analyzing, correcting and developing existing systems while coaching and mentoring young talent. This new career opporunity allows me 
        to reuse my existing skills and build my knowledge base of technology for the benefit of my future employer. I find programming is 
        challenging and rewarding, especially when I find a solution learning new ways to improve code for a project. I hope to work on a 
        team to share in their knowledge and responsibities. Thank you.

    <p>For my group project we developed a website that provides information about NASA and the SpaceX program. Users
      can
      select flights and download flight data about those missions. This site can be used by the curious and in a
      classroom
      setting for students and teachers to learn more about the space exploration history of NASA and SpaceX.

      I enjoyed creating a weather app that users can use to follow the weather for cities in the US. The site was
      created using HTML, CSS3,
      Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery and includes three api calls. Give it a try.

      Check out my day planner app that can help you keep your day's events organized. This app features dynamically
      updated
      HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

      This is our second group project and it was the first assignment that was full stack development. We used NodeJS,
      MySQL, Passport, Bcrypt just to name a few of the languages and packages on this project. The app is deployed in 
      Heroku, In this app the users
      can search a database api and find cocktails by name or ingredient. The user can plan a virtual cocktail party through
      their own Zoom link and send the created invitation to all their friends.
